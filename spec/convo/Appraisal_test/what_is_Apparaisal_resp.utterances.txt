Leadership Capability Model (LCM) is rooted in our Dream, People, Culture framework, and outlines what we want our people to strive for and what is expected of them.
It includes clear, tangible behaviors that are understandable and actionable.
The purpose of the model is to help you identify areas where you can develop new abilities as well as what strengths you can use to become even more effective.
